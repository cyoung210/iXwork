    "Alice is going to Lisbon for a week with her husband and 2 kids. They are looking for a full apartment with separate rooms for parents and children. Money is not an issue for them, but they are looking for a good place. This means they are only looking for places with more than 10 reviews and a score above 4. When we show Alice our listing selection we need to make sure we are sorting the listings from the best score to the worse one. In case some listings have the same score, we will have to sort them by the number of reviews (the more the better). We need to give her  3 alternatives."
